1. modifier MOD_NOREPEAT feature support: I don't know what it is yet
2. double press feature support: make use of the TIME member of the MSG structure
3. complete translate_key_code:
	some ideas here:
	maybe we could use another map table to accelerate the key code mapping?
	support more(or all) keys. the last version is a demo which supports only letter & number KEYs
4. beware of the string buffer overflow. the plugin is currently using a specified size for the command option and log buffer, this minor could be considered latter.
